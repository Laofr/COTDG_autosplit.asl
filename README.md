# COTDG_autosplit.asl
Hello ! I'm Lao_fr

I'm a huge fan of Curse of the dead gods, a great roguelite game.

My dream was to create an autosplitter for livesplit
I think I did it

Even if it's my 1st time creating a script of my entire life (1st time looking for pointers & addresses with CE also)

So be kind with me and this modest ASL script.
It surely not perfect, though it seems to work.

Any improvments will be appreciated.

I'm so excited. I'm gonna submit it in the livesplit autosplitter list
